/*
	This prototype exists to allow ALL enemies, regardless of how they move, to have one common prototype for handling anything common to all enemies (it was getting a tad unwieldy having stuff semi-duplicated between `movable_enemy` and `stationary_vulnerable`).
	
	This may end up mostly being a stub; we've created it as part of the job to create status effects, but it's not clear at this point if some of the logic for those will have to go in `hittable` itself rather than here.
